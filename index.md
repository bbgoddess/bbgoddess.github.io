### CPSC 120


* [Lab 7](https://github.com/cpsc-pilot-fall-2022/cpsc-120-lab-07-boushr_and_arturo) Part 2 was my favourite lab due to the intense difficulty that I faced. This lab was a big step up compared to other labs we completed previously. This was mainly due to the fact that it had many functions in which
all needed to be connected, which was an aspect that was difficult for me to understand. 

* [Lab 12](https://github.com/cpsc-pilot-fall-2022/cpsc-120-lab-12-sama-boushra-ethan) Part 1 was an interesting yet thrilling lab as it required several math aspects into it. Although it was not my first time using math into code, using trigonometric functions was a first, and it required a deep thinking.
In this process, I was able to draw out each step that appeared in the code, trying to understand each process that was taken.

* [Lab 6](https://github.com/cpsc-pilot-fall-2022/cpsc-120-lab-06-boushra_ivan_kiara) Part 1 was a simple yet challenging lab. The simplicity that was given in the instructions made it seem like a very easy process, however the steps inorder to achieve our goal was harder than I thought. The idea of 
using 3 for-loops in our code, and brainstorming when to implement what element at what time was challenging.
